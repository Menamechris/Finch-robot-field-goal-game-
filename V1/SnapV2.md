## Problems it solved

This code solves the issue with the finch not knowing where it is on a grid by always resting back to 0-0.

## The idea on how to implement in java

The plan to implement in java is to have 3 classes:

##### main 

Main picks a random Shooting spot for the finch bot to go to.

##### Grid

creates a play area of shooting spots with a 2D array

##### ShootingSpot

creates a Shooting spot that has the inctions on how to get to said shooting spot from 0,0.
