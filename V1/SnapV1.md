## The idea behind the code

The idea behind this code is, the pointer will go to a random location in a 100 by 100 grid, and once the pointer hit the boundery it would rest at 0-0. The pointer would also always face east once it landed on a random location.

## Problem with the code

The issue with this code is its almost imposible to easly code in the finch robot.This is because the finch bot cant tell you it location on a grid to tell you when it at the edge of the grid.
